Description: Analysis of Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and Biolayer Interferometry data, with automations for high-throughput SPR. This version of the package fits the 1: 1 binding model, with and without bulkshift. It offers optional local or global Rmax fitting. The user must provide a sample sheet and a Carterra output file in Carterra's current format. There is a utility function to convert from Carterra's old output format. The user may run a custom pipeline or use the provided 'Runscript', which will produce a pdf file containing fitted Rmax, ka, kd and standard errors, a plot of the sensorgram and fits, and a plot of residuals. The script will also produce a .csv file with all of the relevant parameters for each spot on the SPR chip.
